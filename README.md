# hessian_distributing
This code is deddicated to distributing calculations of second order derivatives on more GPUs.
It is done in TensorFlow 2 and it uses neural networks. 
The goal was to combine the concepts of neural networks and optimization in order to solve a PDE,
but here the focus is on distributing.
